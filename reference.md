## P: Understand the Problem
Explicit Requirements
- List input & output
- Restate the problem in a simpler way

Implicit Requirements
- Ask clarifying questions (to yourself, your team, or the interviewer)
- Consider edge cases.

Fill in the mental model
- Research any ideas/terms you don't understand fully

## E: Examples/Test Cases
Sometimes useful to start off with test cases:
- `everyOther('The quick brown fox') === 'The brown'`

Sometimes useful to start off a less code-y example:
- 'The quick brown fox' -> 'The brown'

Try to create a test case for every possible **expected** output and input. 

## D: Data Structures
Sometimes the best choice is more obvious, sometimes it's less.

Common in coding challenges: array, dictionary/hash, tuple

[List of data structures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_data_structures)

## A: Algorithm
A step-by-step procedure written in plain language.

Sometimes it helps to start with one of your examples and break down how you got there mentally. 

## C: Code
Follow your algorithm and write it out in code. 

Test little pieces as you go, if you can, to see if you get what you expect.
