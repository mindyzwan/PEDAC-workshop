# PEDAC Workshop
## Description
A set of problems and solutions for learning how to use a problem-solving framework called PEDAC.

PEDAC has been created by an online coding school called [Launch School](https://launchschool.com/). Used and shared with permission!

## During the workshop
We'll be doing a couple breakout sessions - you'll want to have this repo open and handy. Feel free to clone/download or just reference on Github. 

## Contributing
To contribute your solution and PEDAC process notes to the repo (which would be wonderful): 
- Make a copy of the file in the same folder and rename it
- Add your name to the contributors.md file. 
- Submit pull request!

Solutions in a variety of different languages would be ideal, but do what you feel comfortable with. 

**Note:** I may rename and/or condense multiple files if similar solutions in the same language are produced.
